### Date and geographic location of data collection

The genotypes used in this study were chosen from a previous common bean population screened by _F. brasiliense_ to represent diversity in disease severity. From the Cal96 × MLB49-89A population, 13 diverse recombinant inbred lines and the two parental lines were included, for a total of 15 lines used. Two bean seeds were soaked in 10% bleach sterilization solution for 20 min and then washed five times in sterile deionized water. Seedlings were germinated and grown in CYG germination pouches, then placed in a BioChambers BigFoot series growth chamber with 250 mE light intensity, 70% humidity, and 25/20°C day/night temperature on a 14-hour day cycle. After seven days, one seed was treated with sterile deionized water (Mock), while the second was treated with F. brasiliense inoculum (FRR). Seedlings were grown for an additional seven days before data collection. This experiment was repeated five times.
